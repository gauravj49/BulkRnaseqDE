bkRnaseqDE: The bulk RNAseq differential expression analysis pipeline
====================================================

## Overview: 
An open source and fully customized pipeline that:
* Performs DE analysis between conditions
* Run on an HPCC cluster (default) or on a computer/server
* Remove unwanted variation using RUVseq
* Run differential expression analysis with DESeq2
* Draw differential expression heatmaps
* Add gene annotation to results file
* Provides a detailed summary of the analysis in the form of diagnosis plots:
* Detailed logs of every steps
